Python Project ‚Äì How to Build Tony Stark's JARVIS with Python
Ashutosh Krishna
Ashutosh Krishna
Do you remember J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's virtual personal assistant? If you've seen any of the Ironman or Avengers movies, I'm sure you do.

Have you ever wondered whether you could create your own personal assistant? Yes? Tony Stark can help us with that!

tony-snap2_rv5gmh
Oops, did you forget he is no more? It's sad that he can no longer save us. But hey, your favorite programming language Python can help you with that.

Yes, you heard it right. We can create our own J.A.R.V.I.S. using Python. Let's dive into it!

Project Setup
While you're coding this project, you'll come across various modules and external libraries. Let's learn about them and install them. But before we install them, let's create a virtual environment and activate it.

We are going to create a virtual environment using virtualenv. Python now ships with a pre-installed virtualenv library. So, to create a virtual environment, you can use the below command:

$ python -m venv env
The above command will create a virtual environment named env. Now, we need to activate the environment using the command:

$ . env/Scripts/activate
To verify if the environment has been activated or not, you can see (env) in your terminal. Now, we can install the libraries.

pyttsx3: pyttsx is a cross-platform text to speech library which is platform-independent. The major advantage of using this library for text-to-speech conversion is that it works offline. To install this module, type the below command in the terminal:

$ pip install pyttsx3
SpeechRecognition: This allows us to convert audio into text for further processing. To install this module, type the below command in the terminal:
$ pip install SpeechRecognition
pywhatkit: This is an easy-to-use library that will help us interact with the browser very easily. To install the module, run the following command in the terminal:
$ pip install pywhatkit
wikipedia: We'll use this to fetch a variety of information from the Wikipedia website. To install this module, type the below command in the terminal:
$ pip install wikipedia
requests: This is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python that allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. To install the module, run the following command in the terminal:
$ pip install requests
.env File
We need this file to store some private data such as API Keys, Passwords, and so on that are related to the project. For now, let's store the name of the user and the bot.

Create a file named .env and add the following content there:

USER=Ashutosh
BOTNAME=JARVIS
To use the contents from the .env file, we'll install another module called python-decouple as:

$ pip install python-decouple
Learn more about Environment Variables in Python here.

How to Set Up JARVIS with Python
Before we start defining a few important functions, let's create a speech engine first.

import pyttsx3
from decouple import config

USERNAME = config('USER')
BOTNAME = config('BOTNAME')


engine = pyttsx3.init('sapi5')

# Set Rate
engine.setProperty('rate', 190)

# Set Volume
engine.setProperty('volume', 1.0)

# Set Voice (Female)
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)
Let's analyze the above script. First of all, we have initialized an engine using the pyttsx3 module. sapi5 is a Microsoft Speech API that helps us use the voices. Learn more about it here.

Next, we are setting the rate and volume properties of the speech engine using setProperty method.

Now, we can get the voices from the engine using the getProperty method. voices will be a list of voices available in our system. If we print it, we can see as below:

[<pyttsx3.voice.Voice object at 0x000001AB9FB834F0>, <pyttsx3.voice.Voice object at 0x000001AB9FB83490>]
The first one is a male voice and the other one is a female voice. JARVIS was a male assistant in the movies, but I've chosen to set the voice property to the female for this tutorial using the setProperty method.

Note: If you get an error related to PyAudio, download PyAudio wheel from here and install it within the virtual environment.

Also, using the config method from decouple, we are getting the value of USER and BOTNAME from the environment variables.

Enable the Speak Function
The speak function will be responsible for speaking whatever text is passed to it. Let's see the code:

# Text to Speech Conversion
def speak(text):
    """Used to speak whatever text is passed to it"""
    
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()
In the speak() method, the engine speaks whatever text is passed to it using the say() method. Using the runAndWait() method, it blocks during the event loop and returns when the commands queue is cleared.

Enable the Greet Function
This function will be used to greet the user whenever the program is run. According to the current time, it greets Good Morning, Good Afternoon, or Good Evening to the user.

from datetime import datetime


def greet_user():
    """Greets the user according to the time"""
    
    hour = datetime.now().hour
    if (hour >= 6) and (hour < 12):
        speak(f"Good Morning {USERNAME}")
    elif (hour >= 12) and (hour < 16):
        speak(f"Good afternoon {USERNAME}")
    elif (hour >= 16) and (hour < 19):
        speak(f"Good Evening {USERNAME}")
    speak(f"I am {BOTNAME}. How may I assist you?")
First, we get the current hour, that is if the current time is 11:15 AM, the hour will be 11. If the value of hour is between 6 and 12, wish Good Morning to the user. If the value is between 12 and 16, wish Good Afternoon and similarly, if the value is between 16 and 19, wish Good Evening. We are using the speak method to speak to the user.

How to Take User Input
We use this function to take the commands from the user and recognize the command using the speech_recognition module.

import speech_recognition as sr
from random import choice
from utils import opening_text


def take_user_input():
    """Takes user input, recognizes it using Speech Recognition module and converts it into text"""

    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print('Listening....')
        r.pause_threshold = 1
        audio = r.listen(source)

    try:
        print('Recognizing...')
        query = r.recognize_google(audio, language='en-in')
        if not 'exit' in query or 'stop' in query:
            speak(choice(opening_text))
        else:
            hour = datetime.now().hour
            if hour >= 21 and hour < 6:
                speak("Good night sir, take care!")
            else:
                speak('Have a good day sir!')
            exit()
    except Exception:
        speak('Sorry, I could not understand. Could you please say that again?')
        query = 'None'
    return query
